Q

Suppose you are designing a sliding window protocol

1Mbps p2p link to moon

which has a one way latence if 1.25 sec

assuming each frame carries 1KB of data

what is the min no. of bits for seq no.?

----> 

Bandwidth = 1 Mbps
Frame size = 1KB
Tp = 1.25 sec
RTT = 2 x 1.25 = 2.50

Data Size = 2.5 x 1 Mbps = 2.5 Mbps
No. of Packets = Data Size / Frame size = 2.5 Mega bits / 1KB = 305
